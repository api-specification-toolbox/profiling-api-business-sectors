# Profiling API Business Sectors
This is a repository for managing work to define how APIs are impacting specific business sectors. We have a listing of some of the sectors that are already leading the [API Specification Toolbox](http://api.specificationtoolbox.com/), but will be actively defining new sectors and pushing the API conversation.

Like the other projects in the API Specification Toolbox, this is a community effort. We are just getting started with this work, and will need the community to help continue fleshing out the list of sectors that are being impacted by APIs, and being defined by API specifications.

We are using this README to manage this project, and Github issues to manage the conversation and all of the work that occurs around defining all of the areas of this work. If you have any contributions feel free to submit an issue or a pull request on this project, or any other in the API Specification toolbox, including the toolbox itself.
